# Loglog

An app to log your logs! (programmers: not that kind of log)

This app was built for HackNJIT! Loglog uses Nodejs with Express and MySQL on the backend with Vue and axios on the front end. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run express server to connect to mySQL databse
npm run serve

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
